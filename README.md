# RobotTasker RT5000

## Overview:
The RoboTasker 5000 (RT5000), is a programmable robot to support families with basic tasks in their household. This robot has arms and wheels, and it can perform many of the physical tasks that a human can do. It does not, however, have a brain, and it will only do what it is programmed to do, via the “app”. The “app” has the robot perform a simple, but complete, household task. An “app” can take in any number of basic user parameters to customize the task that the user can input from a touchscreen on the top of the robot’s head. 
The new robot product will come with pre-installed tasks that showcase common household tasks that will help new users discover value from their new purchases. One of the pre-installed tasks is performing different basic recipes.
